## Objectives

* Make it easy for users to configure and deploy instances of the JSHomes Platform (currently runs on WordPress).
* Make it easy for developers to set up their dev environment and contribute.

The `wp-content` WordPress directory needs to be on a volume that's shared with the WordPress container.


## Getting Started

These are experimental docs, trying to get the platform up and running on Docker.

### Docker learning resources

* [Docker tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkA60AVN3hh_6cAz8TUGtkYbJSL2bdZ4h), specifically, [docker-compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtoT0By8yh4&index=9&list=PLkA60AVN3hh_6cAz8TUGtkYbJSL2bdZ4h).
* [Docker images](http://blog.thoward37.me/articles/where-are-docker-images-stored/)
* [DIY Dockerfiles](http://blog.thoward37.me/articles/where-are-docker-images-stored/#diy-dockerfiles)
* [Clean up docker containers](http://odino.org/spring-cleaning-of-your-docker-containers/)
* Remove an image: `docker rmi <imagename>@<image-version>`

### Status

Basic docker-compose from the official image docs should work as a base:

* [official docker WordPress image ](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/) Example `docker-compose.yml`



### Docker

Our platform runs on containers -- lightweight virutal environments that don't need the overhead of emulating all the hardware of a virtual machine. Docker is a very popular container solution, and it has predefined WordPress and MySQL container images ready to go!

[Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

Run docker. On OSX you'll want to run Boot2Docker. You'll also need to browse to the boot2docker IP to use it. To get it, run:

```
boot2docker ip
```


### Docker compose

This project uses Docker services for WordPress, MySQL, Mongo, and Redis. That's a lot to manage manually.

Docker compose lets you orchestrate multiple docker images using a simple `docker-compose.yml` config file.

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


Create a directory for your project:

```
mkdir jshomes-platform && cd jshomes-platform
```

Create your `docker-compose.yml` file. If you're using [atom](https://atom.io/):

```
atom docker-compose.yml
```

Paste these contents and save:

```yml
wordpress:
  image: wordpress
  links:
    - db:mysql
    - data
  ports:
    - 8080:80

data:
  image: busybox
  volumes:
    - /data

db:
  image: mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

Save it and run:

```
docker-compose up &
```

# Broken part:

On OS X, we'll make a Samba server to access the `data` container contents:

```
# This bit doesn't work
docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock svendowideit/samba busybox
```
# Broken instructions butchered from:
```
$ # Make a volume container (only need to do this once)
$ docker run -v /data --name my-data busybox true
$ # Share it using Samba (Windows file sharing)
$ docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock svendowideit/samba my-data
$ # then find out the IP address of your Boot2Docker host
$ boot2docker ip
```
# /end broken part

Connect to the shared folder using Finder (OS X). Go -> Connect To: 

```
cifs://192.168.59.103/data
```

Once mounted, will appear as /Volumes/data


## Troubleshooting

Nuke it and start again:

```
docker-compose rm -v
```
